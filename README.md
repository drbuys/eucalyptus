# Eucalyptus by Koala

We decided to make a CMS in React.

Feel free to browse the codebase.


At the moment is is designed to use MongoDB, and requires the ability to create unlimited number of databases on the fly.
 (each site need a new database).
 
 
We are open to any suggestion for improvement and will be continually developing the project in our free time.
